# Simple To-Do List

This project is a lightweight to-do application built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. Tasks are stored in your browser's local storage so your list persists between visits. The UI now features a colorful header, task counters and smooth inline editing.

## Running

## Features

- Clear all completed tasks
- Delete tasks
- Tasks are saved locally in your browser

Feel free to customize the styling or extend the functionality.
